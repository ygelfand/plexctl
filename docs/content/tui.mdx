## Features

### Fuzzy Search
Pressing `/` opens a global fuzzy search overlay. It searches across all indexed libraries for titles, actors, and directors. Results are updated instantly as you type.

### Library Configuration
Pressing `l` opens the configuration manager. Here you can:
- **Hide/Show** specific library sections.
- **Assign Custom Icons** using Emojis, Nerd Fonts, or ASCII.
- **Reorder** how libraries appear in your sidebar.

### Integrated Player
When playback is started, a playback bar appears at the bottom showing:

You can control the player directly from the TUI using `space` to pause/resume and `x` to stop.
